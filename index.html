                <p>
                    <b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar </b> Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 - 6 December 1956) was an Indian economist, jurist, social reformer and political leader who chaired the committee that drafted the Constitution of India based on
                    the debates of the Constituent Assembly of India and the first draft of Sir Benegal Narsing Rau.Ambedkar served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru. He later renounced Hinduism, converted to Buddhism
                    and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement. After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923,
                    respectively, and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s. He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later
                    life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the establishment of
                    the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.

                        Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was the son of Subedar Ramji Maloji Sakpal. He was Subedar in British Army. Babasaheb's father was a follower of Sant Kabir and was also a well-read person.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was hardly two years old when his father retired from service. His mother died when he was only about six. Babasaheb got his early education in Bombay. Since his school days he realized with intense shock what it was to be an
                        untouchable in India.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dr. Ambedkar was taking his school education in Satara. Unfortunately, Dr. Ambedkar lost his mother. His aunt looked after him. Afterwards, they shifted to Bombay. Throughout his school education, he suffered from the curse of untouchability. His marriage
                        took place after his matriculation in 1907 in an open shed of a market.

                    <li>
                        He got his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University in 1915 and 1916 respectively. He then left for London for further studies. He was admitted there to the Gray's Inn for Law and also allowed to prepare for the D. Sc. at the London School of Economics
                        and Political Science. But he was called back to India by the Dewan of Baroda. Later, he got his Bar-at-Law and D.Sc. degree also. He studied for some time at Bonn University in Germany.
                        <li>

                            In 1916 he read an essay on 'Castes in India — their Mechanism, Genesis, and Development'. In 1916, he wrote his thesis 'National dividend for India — A Historic and Analytical Study' and got his Ph.D. Degree. This was published after eight years under
                            the title — “Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India.” Then after getting this highest degree, he returned to India and was appointed a Military Secretary to the Maharaja of Baroda with a view to groom him as the finance
                            minister in the long run. </li>
                        <li>
                            Babasaheb returned to the city in September, 1917 as his scholarship tenure ended and joined the service. But after a brief stay in the city till November, 1917, he left for Mumbai. The maltreatment he faced on grounds of untouchability had forced him
                            to leave the service.

                            He also contributed to India's Independence struggle and in its reforms post-independence. Apart from this, Babasaheb played a significant role in the formation of the Reserve Bank of India. The Central bank was formed on the concept presented by Babasaheb
                            to the Hilton Young Commission.
